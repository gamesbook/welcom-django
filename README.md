#"Welcome Django"

A simple Django app to display welcome messages

Based to a large extent on https://github.com/olifante/django-hello-world but adapted from scratch to work with Django 1.10.

Designed to allow testing of Django deployments e.g. into a Docker container.

Default install has support for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, but uses SQLite as the default.
